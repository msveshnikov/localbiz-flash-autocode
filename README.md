    - Implement a clear and consistent navigation system, likely a sidebar or top navigation menu,
      for easy access to primary sections (Dashboard, Campaigns, Analytics, Goals, Resources).
    - Ensure navigation is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
    - Use clear and concise labels for navigation items.
- **Clean and Uncluttered Interface:**
    - Adopt a minimalist design approach, focusing on essential information and actions on each
      screen.
    - Utilize whitespace effectively to improve readability and reduce cognitive load.
    - Avoid unnecessary visual elements or animations that could distract users.
- **User-Friendly Forms and Inputs:**
    - Design forms for campaign creation, goal setting, and data input to be simple, direct, and
      logically organized.
    - Provide clear labels, tooltips, and input validation to guide users and prevent errors.
    - Minimize the number of steps required to complete key tasks.
- **Actionable Data Visualization:**
    - Employ a variety of charts, graphs, and progress indicators (e.g., line charts, bar charts,
      pie charts, progress bars) to present ROI and performance data visually.
    - Focus on presenting data in a way that highlights key insights and facilitates quick
      understanding.
    - Ensure data visualizations are interactive where appropriate, allowing users to explore data
      in more detail.
- **Consistent Design Language:**
    - Maintain a unified visual style across the platform using Chakra UI's theming capabilities.
    - Establish a consistent typography scale, color palette, spacing, and component styling to
      create a cohesive and professional user experience.
    - Document design patterns and component usage for future development consistency.
- **Mobile-First and Responsive Design:**
    - Prioritize a mobile-first approach to ensure the platform is fully functional and visually
      appealing on smartphones and tablets.

    - **Download and Sharing Options:** Offer options to download resources (where applicable) and
      share them with team members or colleagues.

### Technical Considerations

- **React Component Architecture:**
    - Adhere to a modular and reusable component architecture in React to promote maintainability,
      scalability, and code reusability.
    - Organize components logically within the `src` directory, potentially grouping components by
      page or feature.
    - Utilize functional components and hooks for state management and side effects where
      appropriate.
    - Implement component testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of individual
      components.
- **Chakra UI Implementation:**
    - Fully leverage Chakra UI's component library and theming system to accelerate UI development
      and maintain a consistent design language.
    - Customize the Chakra UI theme to align with the platform's branding and visual identity.
    - Utilize Chakra UI's responsive styles and utilities to ensure responsiveness across different
      screen sizes.
    - Follow Chakra UI's best practices for accessibility and component usage.
- **State Management Strategy:**
    - Implement a robust state management solution to efficiently manage application data.
    - Start with `useState` and `useReducer` for component-level state management.
    - Consider React Context for sharing state across components within specific features or
      modules.
    - Evaluate libraries like Zustand or Recoil for more complex global state management as the
      application scales and the state becomes more intricate.
- **Backend API Integration:**
    - Design the frontend architecture to seamlessly integrate with the backend API for data
      fetching, storage, and processing.
    - Define clear API endpoints and data structures for communication between frontend and backend.
    - Implement efficient data fetching strategies (e.g., data caching, pagination) to optimize
      performance.
    - Handle API errors and loading states gracefully in the UI to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Mobile Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
    - Ensure full responsiveness across a wide range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets,
      smartphones) and screen resolutions.
    - Test the platform on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and browser versions to
      ensure cross-browser compatibility.
    - Utilize browser developer tools for responsive design testing and debugging.
- **Accessibility (WCAG Compliance) Implementation:**
    - Integrate accessibility considerations throughout the development process, not just as an
      afterthought.
    - Conduct accessibility audits and testing using automated tools and manual testing with
      assistive technologies.
    - Provide alternative text for images, captions for videos, and transcripts for audio content.
    - Ensure form elements are properly labeled and accessible to screen readers.
- **Performance Optimization with Vite:**
    - Leverage Vite's optimized build process, code splitting, and efficient development server to
      ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.
    - Optimize React components for performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders, using
      memoization techniques, and optimizing data processing.
    - Monitor application performance and identify areas for optimization using performance
      profiling tools.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:**
    - Design the application with scalability and maintainability in mind to accommodate future
      feature additions and platform growth.
    - Write clean, well-documented code and follow coding best practices.
    - Implement automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure code quality and prevent
      regressions.
    - Adopt a modular architecture that allows for independent development and deployment of
      features.
- **Security Considerations:**
    - Implement security best practices throughout the platform development lifecycle.
    - Consider security aspects in both frontend and backend development.
    - Protect user data and sensitive information by using secure data storage and transmission
      methods.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities like
      cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
    - Stay updated with security best practices and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Integration:** Potential integration with CRM systems to
  streamline lead management, customer interactions, and provide a more holistic view of the
  customer journey.
- **A/B Testing Tools:** Implement A/B testing capabilities for campaigns and landing pages to allow
  users to optimize their marketing efforts through data-driven experimentation.
- **Advanced Goal Setting:** Introduce more sophisticated goal setting options, such as revenue
