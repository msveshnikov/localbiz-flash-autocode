---

**Removed/Completed Items:**

- **[None]** - No items have been completed or removed yet as this is likely the initial backlog
  setup.

**Additional Notes & Comments:**

- **MVP Focus:** The current backlog heavily emphasizes MVP features to get a functional platform
  launched quickly.
- **Iterative Development:** This backlog is designed for iterative development. Focus on completing
  High Priority items in Section I first, then move to Medium Priority in Section II, and so on.
- **Placeholder Data:** For initial frontend development, using placeholder data (mock data) is
  acceptable to allow frontend work to proceed in parallel with backend development. Data
  integration will be a key step after backend API setup.
- **UI/UX Iteration:** The initial UI/UX implementation will be basic. Usability testing and
  feedback will be crucial for future iterations to refine the user experience.
- **Team Communication:** Regular communication between frontend and backend developers is essential
  to ensure API design and data integration are smooth.

This updated backlog provides a starting point for development and will be reviewed and refined as
the project progresses and we learn more. Let's get to work!
