## Sprint Plan: Sprint 1 - Foundation & Authentication

**Sprint Goal:** Establish the technical foundation of the ROI Marketing Platform, including basic user authentication and initial frontend structure, to enable further feature development.

**Sprint Dates:** Wed Feb 19 2025 - Tue Feb 25 2025 (1 week sprint)

**1. Sprint Goal:**

Lay the groundwork for the ROI Marketing Platform by setting up the backend API, database integration, and basic frontend structure. Implement core user authentication functionality to secure the platform and allow user access.

| High     | Feature  | Campaign Management - Basic Structure (Placeholder Form) | 4 hours              |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 60 hours

**3. Estimated Effort Breakdown:**

*   **Backend API Setup - Core Endpoints (16 hours):**
    *   Set up Express.js server with bun.
    *   Define API endpoints for:
        *   User Registration (`/api/auth/register`)
        *   User Login (`/api/auth/login`)
        *   Basic Campaign creation (`/api/campaigns`) - initial endpoint, basic functionality
        *   Placeholder Dashboard data (`/api/dashboard`) - endpoint to serve mock data for now.
    *   Implement basic API logic for each endpoint (minimal functionality for this sprint).

*   **Database Integration - MongoDB Setup (8 hours):**
    *   Set up MongoDB database instance (local or cloud - decide on environment).
    *   Configure Mongoose connection in the backend.
    *   Define Mongoose models for:
        *   `User` (email, password - hashed)
        *   `Campaign` (basic fields: name, description - for initial structure).

*   **Frontend Component Structure & Routing (8 hours):**
    *   Structure `src/` directory with page components (`DashboardPage.jsx`, `CampaignsPage.jsx`, `AnalyticsPage.jsx`, `GoalsPage.jsx`, `ResourcesPage.jsx`).
    *   Implement React Router for basic navigation between these pages.
    *   Set up basic layout structure in `App.jsx` with navigation (even if links are initially placeholders).

*   **User Authentication (Login/Registration) (20 hours):**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Create Registration form (`/register` route).
        *   Create Login form (`/login` route).
        *   Handle form submission and API calls to backend (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`).
        *   Basic form validation and error handling.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Implement user registration logic (validate input, hash password, save to MongoDB).
        *   Implement user login logic (authenticate user, generate token/session - basic for now).
        *   Implement basic password hashing and salting for security.

*   **ROI Tracking Dashboard - Basic Structure (Placeholder) (4 hours):**
    *   Create `DashboardPage.jsx` component.
    *   Set up basic layout with placeholder widgets or sections to represent future ROI metrics.
    *   Display static placeholder data (no API integration yet for this sprint).

*   **Campaign Management - Basic Structure (Placeholder Form) (4 hours):**
    *   Create `CampaignsPage.jsx` component.
    *   Set up basic layout for listing campaigns (initially empty or with placeholder list).
    *   Create a basic placeholder form within `CampaignsPage.jsx` for "Create Campaign" with fields: Campaign Name, Description (no actual form submission or backend integration yet).

**4. Dependencies and Risks:**

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Frontend User Authentication is dependent on Backend API Setup and Database Integration being functional for user data persistence and authentication logic.
    *   Frontend page structures are dependent on Frontend Component Structure & Routing being in place.
*   **Risks:**
    *   **Backend setup with bun, Express.js, and MongoDB might encounter initial configuration issues.** Time has been allocated for potential troubleshooting.
    *   **Security implementation for user authentication needs careful consideration.** Ensure basic security best practices are followed for password handling in this initial phase.
    *   **Potential for scope creep.** It's crucial to stay focused on the sprint goal and selected tasks. Defer any non-essential enhancements or features to future sprints.

**5. Definition of Done for the Sprint:**

*   **Backend API:**
    *   Express.js server is running successfully with bun.
    *   API endpoints for User Registration, User Login, Basic Campaign creation, and Placeholder Dashboard data are implemented and functional (even with basic logic).
    *   API documentation (basic, e.g., list of endpoints and request/response structure) is available.
*   **Database:**
    *   MongoDB database is set up and connected to the backend.
    *   Mongoose models for `User` and `Campaign` are defined.
    *   User registration data can be successfully saved to the database.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   React application is running without errors.
    *   Frontend routing is implemented, and navigation between pages is functional (even with placeholder content).
    *   Basic page components (`DashboardPage.jsx`, `CampaignsPage.jsx`, `AnalyticsPage.jsx`, `GoalsPage.jsx`, `ResourcesPage.jsx`) are created and have basic layout structure.
    *   User Registration and Login forms are implemented in the frontend and are connected to the backend API.
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Users can successfully register an account via the registration form.
    *   Users can successfully log in to the platform using their registered credentials.
    *   Basic password hashing is implemented for user security.
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Code is clean, reasonably well-commented, and pushed to a version control system (e.g., Git repository).
    *   Basic code review is performed for backend and frontend code.
*   **Team Agreement:**
    *   The team agrees that all selected sprint tasks are completed according to the acceptance criteria defined for each task and the overall sprint goal is achieved.
